//TASK 22 
//Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. 
//Change an index in one of your programs
//to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

const days : string[] = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"];

// console.log (days{7}); this will throw an index error because we use curly braces in array .

console.log (days[6])
